@par Example Description 

How to use the ADC1 and DMA to transfer continuously converted data from 
ADC1 to memory.

The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously channel8 (ADC1_IN8, pin PB.00 on STM32F407xx Device).

Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers(DMA2 Stream0, Channel 0), in circular mode,
the converted data from ADC1 DR register to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable.

In this example, the system clock is 144MHz, APB2 = 72MHz and ADC clock = APB2/2. 
Since ADC3 clock is 36 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/36= 0.41us(2.4Msps).

User can vary the ADC1 channel8 (for STM32F4-Discovery) voltage probing external
power supply on PB.00 Gpio pin.

STM32 DISCO boards LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED4 is ON when the conversion is complete.
 - LED5 is ON when there are an error in initialization.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.
